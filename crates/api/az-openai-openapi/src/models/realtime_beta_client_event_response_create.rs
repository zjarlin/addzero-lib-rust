/// This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering model inference. When
/// in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses automatically. A Response will include at least
/// one Item, and may have two, in which case the second will be a function call. These Items will be
/// appended to the conversation history. The server will respond with a `response.created` event,
/// events for Items and content created, and finally a `response.done` event to indicate the Response
/// is complete. The `response.create` event can optionally include inference configuration like
/// `instructions`, and `temperature`. These fields will override the Session's configuration for this
/// Response only. Responses can be created out-of-band of the default Conversation, meaning that they
/// can have arbitrary input, and it's possible to disable writing the output to the Conversation. Only
/// one Response can write to the default Conversation at a time, but otherwise multiple Responses can
/// be created in parallel. Clients can set `conversation` to `none` to create a Response that does not
/// write to the default Conversation. Arbitrary input can be provided with the `input` field, which is
/// an array accepting raw Items and references to existing Items.
