/// When the number of tokens in a conversation exceeds the model's input token limit, the conversation
/// be truncated, meaning messages (starting from the oldest) will not be included in the model's
/// context. A 32k context model with 4,096 max output tokens can only include 28,224 tokens in the
/// context before truncation occurs. Clients can configure truncation behavior to truncate with a lower
/// max token limit, which is an effective way to control token usage and cost. Truncation will reduce
/// the number of cached tokens on the next turn (busting the cache), since messages are dropped from
/// the beginning of the context. However, clients can also configure truncation to retain messages up
/// to a fraction of the maximum context size, which will reduce the need for future truncations and
/// thus improve the cache rate. Truncation can be disabled entirely, which means the server will never
/// truncate but would instead return an error if the conversation exceeds the model's input token
/// limit.
