/// Send this event to append audio bytes to the input audio buffer. The audio buffer is temporary
/// storage you can write to and later commit. A "commit" will create a new user message item in the
/// conversation history from the buffer content and clear the buffer. Input audio transcription (if
/// enabled) will be generated when the buffer is committed. If VAD is enabled the audio buffer is used
/// to detect speech and the server will decide when to commit. When Server VAD is disabled, you must
/// commit the audio buffer manually. Input audio noise reduction operates on writes to the audio
/// buffer. The client may choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum of 15 MiB, for
/// example streaming smaller chunks from the client may allow the VAD to be more responsive. Unlike
/// most other client events, the server will not send a confirmation response to this event.
